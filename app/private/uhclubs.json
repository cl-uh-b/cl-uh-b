Burns School of Medicine with undergraduate students interested in pursuing a career in medicine. Through these pairings, our goal is to help foster relationships between undergraduates and medical students and faculty. Over the years, we have paired more than 600 mentees with medical student mentors via an extensive matching process. Mentor-mentee pairs contact each other regularly and participate in a variety of activities throughout the year.",

Educational outreach programs on immunization led by university- or graduate-level students are limited in Hawaii. Because the majority of SII members participate in biomedical research including vaccine development, they have insight on the concepts and benefits of vaccines. Through SII educational events not only will the public benefit from learning about the importance of vaccination and disease prevention, but members will also develop skills in explaining difficult health topics to the community.",
